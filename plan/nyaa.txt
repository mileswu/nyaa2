# Nyaa2 Project Documentation: How to be better than Nyaa #
###########################################################

- Automatic instant refresh
  *  HTML Push perhaps via WebSockets
  +> As fresh as possible. No need to refresh

- Notification / Filters?
  +> Users can find the shows they want faster

- Series grouping
  *  Could group by group/ep too
  +> Would make it easier to find eps
  -> How to do it automatically without making mistakes? Or manually without making it a hassle for the uploader?
  *  Perhaps use anidb series listing + autocomplete? Weight for newer series as they are more likely.
  *  Various sort methods (exhaustive better than not enough) video codec, audio codec, subtitle format (could grab this info if taking screenshots?)

- Screenshots
  *  Automatic: Downloads torrent, uses mplayer to get screenshots
  *  Manual upload
  +> Allows people to see what they are DLing
  -> NSFW/non-legal concerns
  -> Uses bandwidth and space (could be mitigated through tinypic)
  -> Would take time, especially if there were slow seeders

- More reliable. Less downtime. Less bugs.

- Easier/faster to use

- Provide more flexible listing pages and controls for fansub uploaders

- Cool features

- Some kind of IRC integration perhaps?
  *  a bot that announces torrent adds and can also dcc send the .torrent (upon request)
    -> dcc send may be a bit unrealistic if a lot of files are being added

- Add specific support for DDL links
  +> Attracts users who don't use torrents
    *  Also attracts people who make money by posting ddl links?
  -> Perhaps needs checking for dead links

- Autosource everything listed on TokyoTosho
  +> More content
  -> Lowers SnR

- Automatically crosslist onto TokyoTosho and Nyaa
  +> Saves time for fansub uploaders
  +> Fansub uploaders won't feel like here won't have as wide a reach
  -> Allows users to still use TT and Nyaa
    *  Just make it so awesome they won't WANT to
